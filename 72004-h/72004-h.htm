<p>Since the publication of my “H. P. Lovecraft:
A Bibliography” (Biblio Press, 1952), I have been repeatedly
urged to write out my opinion of Lovecraft’s
work. I have been kept from doing so by the pressure
of a full-time library job, plus my own creative work
in the diverse fields of the horror story, the western
story, and poetry, as well as the semi-annual publication
of ESSENCE and other time-consuming activities
such as an unending struggle against censorship groups
which are violating Constitutional rights on both a local
and national level.</p>

<p>The following brief essay is an admittedly hurried
and incomplete attempt to meet demands for a Lovecraft
critique. An entire book, requiring many months of
uninterrupted work, could be devoted to the project and
I sincerely regret that circumstances do not permit me
to undertake such a task. But I hope that my comments,
in spite of their brevity, will be of some interest.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years have passed since Lovecraft’s
death, but, unfortunately, a final evaluation of the man
and of his work is still not possible. His collected
poems, though due to appear shortly, have not yet been
published. His letters, either selected or collected,
have not appeared. Probably some of the pieces
which he contributed under pseudonyms to “little” magazines
have never been reprinted. And of course no
complete and carefully written biography of the man
has ever been published.</p>

<p>With the important exception of the poems and
letters however, all of Lovecraft’s work of any significance
has been in print for some years. It seems
doubtful, therefore, that an evaluation of his work, at
this time, will be seriously qualified by future publication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>In his essay on Lovecraft, “Tales of the Marvellous
and the Ridiculous”, which originally appeared in “The
New Yorker” and was later reprinted in his book, “Classics
and Commercials”, Edmund Wilson states flatly:
“Lovecraft was not a good writer.” (Before Lovecraft
admirers reach for their shotguns, I might point out
that Edmund Wilson also refers to no less a literary
figure than Somerset Maugham as “second-rate” and
“a half-trashy novelist.”) Even though his criticism
is far too severe—too much of a generalization—Wilson
does call attention to two Lovecraft faults which I
must reluctantly acknowledge: his frequent prolixity
and his tendency to lean on shopworn adjectives such
as “terrible”, “horrible”, “hellish”, etc. to achieve
eerie effects. In a good horror story, adjectives
such as this are best omitted or at least introduced
very sparingly. Beyond these criticisms, Wilson emphasizes
the essential weakness and lack of verisimilitude
of the “Cthulhu Mythos” episodes. With this, too,
I must grudgingly agree. And at this point I would
like to call attention to the fact that the two specific
faults mentioned immediately above—prolixity and adjectivitus—are
more frequently encountered in the
“Mythos” stories than in any others.</p>

<p>The “Cthulhu Mythos” has raised a great commotion.
Over a period of years, enthusiastic collaborators,
imitators, friends and admirers have elevated
the Cthulhu myth to a pedestal of importance which it
scarcely deserves. The “Mythos” did indeed become
the frame for Lovecraft’s later tales, but they were
not his best tales. Lovecraft also amused himself by
employing Cthulhu terminology in some of his huge
correspondence, but it now seems doubtful that he attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
as much importance to the “Mythos” as do
some of his disciples!</p>

<p>Many of the Cthulhu stories, such as “The Dunwich
Horror” and “The Whisperer in Darkness”, are
actually tedious. They are too long; our interest is
apt to flag; our “willing suspension of disbelief” may
not hold to the final page. All too often we read on
without compulsion, without belief, without very much
actual enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Lovecraft often seems so intent on introducing and
exploiting the “Mythos”, he loses sight of some of the
basic elements which are essential in a good short
story: economy of wordage, verisimilitude, mounting
suspense sweeping to a single climax followed quickly
by the final denouement.</p>

<p>Referring to the “Mythos”, Edmund Wilson concluded:
“It is all more amusing in his letters than it
is in the stories themselves.” Of course it was not
intended to be <span class="u">amusing</span> in the stories, but I think
Wilson’s meaning is clear.</p>

<p>When it still possessed the freshness of novelty,
the Cthulhu Mythology afforded a vast amount of entertainment.
But with the passage of time the novelty has
evaporated and the myth has become threadbare. Lovecraft
used it in story after story and his disciples have
exploited it since his death and it now seems wrung
nearly dry of interesting effects.</p>

<p>It remains, of course, an integral part of the bulk
of Lovecraft’s work. To attempt to dismiss it as incidental
or unimportant would be to close our eyes to the
facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>In my opinion however, Lovecraft’s future reputation
as a writer of fine horror stories will rest on a
very few of his early tales in which the Cthulhu Mythos
is either entirely absent or at most still in its formative
stages in Lovecraft’s own mind. These early
stories which I mean to mention were published prior
to the appearance of the first generally accepted
“Mythos” story: “The Call of Cthulhu” (WEIRD TALES,
February, 1928)</p>

<p>These stories are: “The Hound” (WEIRD TALES,
February, 1924); “The Rats in the Walls” (WEIRD
TALES, March, 1924); “The Music of Erich Zann”
(WEIRD TALES, May, 1925); “The Outsider” (WEIRD
TALES, April, 1926); “Pickman’s Model” (WEIRD
TALES, October, 1927)</p>

<p>Of these I think the best of all is “The Music of
Erich Zann.” This piece, which might have been
written by Poe, has everything which many of the
“Mythos” tales lack: compression, sustained and
rising suspense culminating in a powerfully effective
climax followed almost immediately by the end of the
story. Stylistically and structurally, I think Lovecraft
never surpassed it. I think it probable that the
old German mute will go on sawing his accursed viol
in that ghoul-infested garret long after great Cthulhu
has lapsed into silence! This story, like Poe’s masterpiece,
“The Cask of Amontillado”, seems literally
above criticism. There are no wasted words. The
brief story unfolds with a remorseless inevitability.
Nothing could be omitted, nothing added, nothing
changed which would improve its quality. In its particular
genre it remains a pure masterpiece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>After “The Music of Erich Zann”, I would cite
“The Rats in the Walls.” Actually, I very nearly
voted it first place because it achieves a pitch of sheer
grisly horror which exceeds the taut terror of “The
Music of Erich Zann.” On the other hand, it does not
possess quite the same degree of purity and compression.
But it is a masterpiece of its type, and again I
can think of no Lovecraft story after “The Music of
Erich Zann” which equals it. As a matter of fact, one
almost feels that Lovecraft has gone too far in this particular
story. Something inside one rebels as the
ghastly eldrich grottos reveal their loathsome secrets.
Perhaps it is simply that one instinctively refuses to
believe that homo sapiens could ever descend to such
a hellish sub-level. But this is a philosophical comment,
not a criticism of the story.</p>

<p>“The Rats in the Walls” begins in the somewhat
leisurely manner which has come to be associated
with rather old-fashioned gothic ghost stories, and
for some little time nothing really hair-raising happens.
But once the full horror comes to light, it simply
overwhelms us. We see at once that the leisurely
start was intended to lull us a little. Certainly it kept
us interested enough to continue, and we <span class="u">did</span> perhaps
expect some pretty formidable horrors—but nothing
like what we finally encounter! For sheer inhuman
horror those twilit grottos under the evil foundations
of Exham Priory have yet to be surpassed.</p>

<p>In his introduction to “Best Supernatural Stories of
H. P. Lovecraft”, August Derleth states: “It has been
said of “The Outsider” that if the manuscript had been
put forward as an unpublished tale by Edgar Allan Poe,
none would have challenged it.” Perhaps this is not
literally true, but I agree with the spirit of it. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
Outsider” is one of Lovecraft’s finest stories. It
possesses the merit of compression; with rising intensity
it achieves its single shuddery effect—and ends.
Some aspects of this story call to mind Poe’s “The
Masque of the Red Death”; both stories achieve their
effects with a minimum of wordage, both linger in the
mind.</p>

<p>“Pickman’s Model” is one of Lovecraft’s strongest
stories. It has unity of effect, suspense, a highly
original plot idea, and a climax which neatly and
forcefully ends the story. It is not quite as tightly
knit as “The Music of Erich Zann” or “The Outsider”,
but it is still Lovecraft writing at his top-level best.
The “nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes”
gnawing at a human head would probably feel at home
in one of those unspeakable grottos under the infamous
walls of Exham Priory!</p>

<p>I have mentioned Lovecraft’s “The Hound” because
it has remained in my mind after I first read it many
years ago. Its structure is somewhat slight and it
does not have the power of Lovecraft’s very best tales,
but it has splendid atmosphere and, again, brevity and
unity of effect. It might have been written by the early
Poe. But I cite it primarily because it has lingered
long in my mind.</p>

<p>The limitations of this little critique do not permit
me to touch on many other good Lovecraft stories.
I have mentioned only five which I think are the best.
I am merely expressing a personal opinion—a personal
taste—and I am more than willing to admit of other
opinions—no matter how they may differ from my own.
Time alone will decide who is right!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>I have not yet seen all of Lovecraft’s poetry, but
I think I have seen enough to comment briefly. Much
of the poetry falls into two main categories: deliberately
archaic work imitative of eighteenth-century
verse, and a group of weird sonnets known as “Fungi
from Yuggoth.” The imitative verse is interesting
and often competent, but I think the “Fungi” sonnets
are far more arresting and effective. A few of the
very best of them may survive.</p>

<p>Any criticism of Lovecraft’s work, no matter how
brief, would be incomplete if it omitted mention of
his famous essay, “Supernatural Horror in Literature.”
Even Edmund Wilson concedes that the essay is “a
really able piece of work.” In my pamphlet, “H. P.
Lovecraft: A Bibliography”, I commented: “The
background and evolution of the horror tale—a “must”
for anyone seriously interested in the genre.” The
comment still holds. Apart from the letters, I think
it is probably the finest piece of non-fiction which
Lovecraft ever wrote.</p>

<p>Judging from the few letters and extracts from
letters which are in print, Lovecraft’s “Selected
Letters” (or “Collected”) will definitely enhance his
reputation. It is probable that their publication will
revive and intensify interest in both the man and his
work. Lovecraft’s erudition, humor and style is such
that it is even possible they will eventually tend to
eclipse his other work! At this point we can only
wait and see.</p>

<p>Lovecraft’s final place in American literature has
not yet been determined. It is too early for that.
But it seems certain that the very best of his work
will endure, that it will remain important in the particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
field which he chose. If he did not reach the
summits attained by Poe, or Bierce, at his best he
scaled some dizzy heights.</p>
